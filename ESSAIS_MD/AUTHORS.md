toulbar2 was originally developped by Toulouse (INRAE MIAT) and Barcelona (UPC, IIIA-CSIC) teams, hence the name of the solver. 

Additional contributions by:
* Caen University, France (GREYC) and University of Oran, Algeria for (parallel) variable neighborhood search methods
* The Chinese University of Hong Kong and Caen University, France (GREYC) for global cost functions
* Marseille University, France (LSIS) for tree decomposition heuristics
* Ecole des Ponts ParisTech, France (CERMICS/LIGM) for [INCOP][incop] local search solver
* University College Cork, Ireland (Insight) for a Python interface in [Numberjack][numberjack] and a portfolio dedicated to UAI graphical models [Proteus][proteus]
* Artois University, France (CRIL) for an XCSP 2.1 format reader of CSP and WCSP instances
